Hellooooo! I'm Subhash. I'm an 18 years old Computer Engineering fresher at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala. This blog of mine is all about my personal experiences. I'm a massive fan of racing so there might be a few posts about it here and there :D

I'm starting to write about things that help students since I discovered so many people are not aware of these things. A few examples are the freebies and discounts that come with our status as university students. So if you're a student, my blog will hopefully be helpful for you.

And thanks for reading my blog! Follow me on all my socials mentioned below.
