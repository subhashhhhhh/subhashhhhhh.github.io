The results of a study done in cooperation with the UN Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that the amount of electronic trash generated last year hit a new record of 53.6 million metric tonnes.

The greatest volume of waste was generated by the Asian area, which released over 24.9 metric tonnes of waste. Following this, the United States weighs in with 13.1 metric tonnes, while Europe follows with 12 metric tonnes.\
This waste can be viewed in three ways.

*First*, one can calculate the total weight of all the adults in Europe. *Another* perspective is to compare the weight of all the adults in Europe to the weight of 350 cruise ships. Additionally, they pointed out that the wasted materials represented a significant loss of important resources as well as the risk of environmental toxins such as mercury.

It is self-evident that governments, businesses, and civil society all have a role to play in solving this e-waste problem that has gone ignored for so long. The Right to Repair movement strives to reduce e-waste by making electrical and electronic items easier to repair.

## Repair is a human right.

The Right to Repair, or the right to modify or repair electronics, is also a reference to the necessity of government intervention in the form of legislative legislation that provides consumers with the right to modify and repair their own electronics.

Currently, most companies that produce these products demand that their customers use only their services, for example, by adding a tamper-proof outer casing as a safeguard.

## The Origins

The Right to Repair (RTOR) began in the United States in the automotive industry, specifically with the concept. This led to the formation of The Repair Association (TRA) in 2013, which applies the same principles to electronic products in an extensive way.

Manufacturers have done everything in their power to make spare parts harder to come by, including delaying the date when spare parts are made available by allowing them to be made available for only a limited time after the product is first released. As well as prohibitions on who can repair them, there are often provisions for who is permitted to do so.

It's making progress in all of these areas with the 'Right to Repair' movement.

## The benefits

Initiatives such as the Right to Repair movement are designed to help reduce both energy consumption and global carbon emissions while also lowering energy bills for consumers.

If I could fix my electronic devices at home, I would extend the life of the products, but the cost of having a professional repair person would be much more costly.

These policies are designed to promote growth in a more competitive repair industry while helping local businesses and people while also protecting the environment in the long term.

Most manufacturers prefer to replace a broken device rather than repair it, which encourages you to purchase a new one. Right to Repair encourages people to fix things themselves rather than using or paying for services that offer a limited range of "approved" repairers to do it for them.

## The Concerns

At first glance, the Right to Repair scheme should benefit consumers, but there are some factors to consider as well.

## Safety

With regards to customer demand, customers who require their electronic devices to be repaired typically desire prompt, economical repairs. Faster performance and lower prices are typically the priorities, and making the devices work on your own could be frustrating and time-consuming because of replacement parts' delays, as well as the fact that the work could be dangerous.

It is suggested that manufacturers include information on where to find spare parts and on how to fix the device so that people do not cause any accidents.

## Security

The ability to be trusted is paramount when it comes to establishing the right to repair law. According to the Security Industry Association (SIA), allowing customers to fix their own devices poses a significant risk because it could open the door for hackers to obtain even more access and power.

Consumers should do their own research and learn about how to avoid creating any security risks for manufacturers.

## Environment

Replacing damaged equipment, rather than replacing it, should result in fewer carbon emissions and less waste when compared to simply discarding or dumping the item. Instead of repairing and reusing used goods, thousands of them are instead disposed of, destroyed, or simply discarded.

In other words, to minimize post-sale material waste, manufacturers must make sure their after-sales service is both effective and efficient. This will help consumers dispose of less post-sale material, while also advising them on the best methods for recycling any potentially defective parts that are extracted.

## What legislation is being passed that will support the Right to Repair?

In March 2021, the right to repair legislation was approved in Great Britain, the EU, and Ireland. It has already been accepted by 14 states in the USA since February 2021. These new regulations intend to help lengthen the lifespan of products by 10 years, while also cutting back on one and a half million tonnes of waste generated by electronics.

### United States

According to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG), fourteen states have passed Right to Repair legislation: Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, and Washington. Montana has two separate laws that are in the process of being passed that will cover both agricultural equipment and consumer technology. Other states are expected to follow.

### European Union

Beginning in March 2021, the first eco-design regulation requires manufacturers of washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators, and monitors to use standardized repair parts that consumers can easily access.

To date, no EU eco-design directive has regulated cell phones, computers, and tablets, meaning these devices are some of the most harmful consumer waste. 60% of electronic equipment in France will be repairable by 2026, thanks to the French government's initiative.

### The United Kingdom

To ensure that consumers will have the right to repair themselves the goods they buy, the UK government plans to have the Right to Repair scheme come into effect in summer 2021. It is only reasonable that new regulations should go into effect soon, given what was agreed upon two years ago by the UK and EU member states.

## Many companies are reacting to the rise of R2R.

Even though Apple touts its support for the environment and customers, the company is working against customers' and electronics repair users' right to fix broken Apple products by using cheap, unproven third-party resources.

While Apple has done an excellent job of making it nearly impossible to obtain resources, they have also made it clear that they have no plans to make it easier for end-users to repair iPhones.

The manufacturers of John Deere are arguing against the right to repair legislation, claiming tractors are difficult to repair. Farm equipment manufacturer John Deere asserts that if a farmer wants to repair their own equipment, they should be able to since they have all the available tools to do so.

Thus, according to John Deere, shouldn't farmers be able to gain access to a repair system that includes available repair tools?

## How Will This Affect Manufacturers and Buyers

The Right to Repair plan places new requirements on electronic product manufacturers, but the initiative has a competitive advantage for these companies.

An industry panel will examine Europe's E&E landscape, including challenges and opportunities as a result of the Right to Repair initiative's implementation.
