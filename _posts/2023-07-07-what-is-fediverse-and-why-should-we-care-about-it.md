Elon Musk’s Twitter competitor, Threads, a new app from Meta, was finally released yesterday after much anticipation. remarkably, 44 million users had registered on Threads in just 24 hours. In their introduction blog, Meta made note of the fact that Threads is designed to operate using an open social networking protocol, which means posts produced on the app can also be seen on other platforms.

Users can already sign up for Threads by logging into their Instagram account, which will transfer their followers, and other personal information. They also claimed working with ActivityPub, a standard used by decentralized networks like Mastodon, on projects together. Despite the fact that Threads does not now support ActivityPub, the platform’s terms and conditions for signing up mention the “fediverse.”

## What is ActivityPub protocol?

ActivityPub is a lesser-known protocol that has the capability to revolutionize the social web, promoting decentralization and user autonomy. This article will discuss how ActivityPub is transforming the social landscape of the internet.

 

The great thing about ActivityPub is its interoperability; it allows for communication between different social networks, making it easier to follow and connect with users on different platforms. This means users can keep their followers and links even when they switch networks. This is a big step forward in creating an open and inclusive social web.

Furthermore, ActivityPub stands for decentralized social networking; here, the user interface and the underlying data are not controlled by a single entity. This is in contrast to the current model, where one company owns and maintains a social network.

ActivityPub is transforming the way we interact with social media. It offers users the ability to choose the platform that works best for them, without sacrificing their connections. It gives them the power to switch platforms easily, giving them more control over their online presence. Major players in the tech industry such as Tumblr, Flipboard and Medium have all adopted ActivityPub, recognizing its potential to create a more open and user-centric web. Mozilla, the organization behind Firefox, has also shown support. 

 

Additionally, Mastodon, a social platform built on ActivityPub, has become increasingly popular with those seeking an alternative to mainstream social media sites. This shift is challenging the dominance of closed social networks and providing users with more independence and data ownership. ActivityPub is paving the way for a more diverse and user-centric social web.

The impact of enabling interoperability and decentralization on the internet's social fabric is tremendous. Increasingly, major tech companies are embracing ActivityPub, and platforms such as Mastodon are becoming more popular, bringing the concept of a decentralized social network closer to reality. In order to create a more open and inclusive online environment, we need to invest in ActivityPub-based platforms that offer users more control over their data. It is time to reimagine social networking and grant users more authority in the digital world.
