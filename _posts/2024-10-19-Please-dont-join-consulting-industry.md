Alright guys, let's get real. We're CS students, the ones who are supposed to be coding the next big thing, building apps that'll change the world, and maybe even launching the next big thing from our dorm rooms. But then placement season hits, and it's like someone flipped a switch. Suddenly, everyone's ditching their hoodies and jeans for those tight suits and ties, ditching their dreams of becoming the next Zuckerberg for a chance to become... consultants? Seriously?

I mean, I get it. Money talks. Those big consulting firms wave around those fat paychecks, and suddenly everyone forgets about their "passion" for tech. It's like watching a bunch of brilliant minds get hypnotized by materialistic cash, willingly walking into the soul-crushing abyss of corporate labour. But come on, people! We're better than this!

It's not just about the money, though. There's this whole sneaky idea floating around that consulting is the "elite" path for CS grads. You get to work on "strategic projects" for those big-shot Fortune 500 companies. Sounds all fancy and important, right? But let's be real, it's mostly just smoke and mirrors.

This YouTuber named Anna Bocca, an ex-consultant, she exposed the whole consulting industry, and let me tell you, it ain't pretty. A lot of these "elite" consultants are just fresh-out-of-college kids with barely any experience, armed with nothing but PowerPoint and a talent for smooth-talking. They're like the masters of illusion, making you think they're delivering some incredible value while they're actually charging insane amounts of money for basic analyses and recycled solutions.

And here's the thing that really gets me fired up: consulting isn't just some harmless career choice; it's straight-up messing up the tech world and society in general. These firms, they're like sharks, always hungry for more profit, and they don't care who they hurt along the way. They push businesses to put profits above everything else, even if it means firing people, cutting corners on safety, and treating workers like robots.

Think about it: while we're busting our butts in coding boot camps and hackathons, dreaming of building the next killer app or some groundbreaking tech, our classmates who went into consulting are helping those big corporations squeeze every last penny out of their customers. They're not building the future; they're keeping the same old broken system running, and often, they're making it even worse.

Let's talk about the opioid crisis for a minute. This is where it gets really messed up. The YouTuber I talked about earlier, she lays out exactly how consulting firms like McKinsey played a huge part in this whole disaster. They told those drug companies how to market those super addictive OxyContin like there was no tomorrow, even though everyone knew how dangerous they were. They helped those companies trick the government, hide the risks, and rake in the cash, all while people were getting hooked, overdosing, and dying.

And it's not just the opioid crisis. These consulting firms are like puppet masters, pulling the strings everywhere, from government policies to climate change. They tell governments to sell off public services and outsource everything, which basically screws over regular people. They work with those big oil and gas companies on "green initiatives" while also advising governments on climate policies. It's like playing both sides of the field, and it totally messes up any chance we have of actually fixing the planet.

So, my fellow CS peeps, I'm begging you: don't fall for this trap! Don't let those big salaries and fancy offices blind you to what really matters. Remember why you got into tech in the first place. Remember how exciting it was to create something new, to solve those brain-twisting problems, to actually make a difference in the world.

We're not just code monkeys; we're innovators, creators, the ones who can change the game. We have the power to shape the future of tech, to use it for good, to build a world where everyone has a chance to thrive. But we can't do that if we're all stuck in those corporate cubicles, making pointless PowerPoint slides and helping those big companies do shady stuff. Choose coding, choose passion, choose to make a real impact. Don't let the consulting world suck you in and turn you into something you're not. The world needs you to be more than just a number cruncher; it needs you to be yourself!

**Now, let's dive deeper into this whole opioid crisis thing, because it's seriously messed up.**
Imagine this: You're a consultant at McKinsey. You're working with a big pharmaceutical company that makes these painkillers, opioids. Specifically something called OxyContin. They're super effective for pain relief, but they're also highly addictive. You know this. You've seen the reports, the studies, the alarming rise in addiction rates and overdoses. But your client, the drug company, they don't want to hear about that. They want to sell more pills, make more money.
So, what do you do? Do you speak up, raise your concerns, maybe even suggest they tone down their marketing and focus on responsible prescribing practices? Nah, that's not how the consulting game works. You put on your "yes-man" hat, you bury your conscience under a pile of spreadsheets, and you get to work.

You analyze data, identify the doctors who are most likely to overprescribe these drugs, and create targeted marketing campaigns to push even more pills into their hands. You come up with fancy strategies to bypass regulations, downplay the risks, and maximize profits. You even help them lobby the government to loosen restrictions and make it easier to get these addictive drugs. And all the while, people are getting hooked, their lives are falling apart, and families are being torn apart by addiction. Overdoses are skyrocketing, communities are being ravaged, and the healthcare system is overwhelmed. But hey, at least your client is happy, right? Their stock price is soaring, their executives are getting fat bonuses, and you're getting a nice pat on the back for a job well done.

This is the reality of the consulting industry. It's a world where profits trump ethics, where short-term gains outweigh long-term consequences, and where the pursuit of wealth and power often comes at the expense of human lives.

The opioid crisis is just one example of how consulting firms can contribute to societal harm. They've been involved in all sorts of shady dealings, from helping corporations evade taxes to advising governments on policies that benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor.

So, if you're a student with a conscience, if you actually care about making a positive impact on the world, think long and hard before you jump on the consulting bandwagon. There are plenty of other ways to use your skills and talents for good, without compromising your values or contributing to the problems that plague our society.

**Choose wisely, my friends. The future is in your hands.**
